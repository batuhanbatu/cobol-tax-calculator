#
Hi, in this article, I will let you know about how to perform a tax calculator program with COBOL.

First of all, I want you to know how to run a COBOL program, I explained all the details in my another repository, you can reach that from here: https://github.com/batuhanbatu/hello-world-cobol

After running program, the program will ask you to enter an amount which should be a number. Then, the program will decide whether you have a tax or not. According to the result of that, if you will have a tax, the formula of the tax is simply as "given amount x 0.1" and you will see the result on the screen.
